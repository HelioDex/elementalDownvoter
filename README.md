# ElementalDownvoter

I've now started this project! It uses data from Elemental by GoVed and uses Google account IDs to send packets to the server.
There is also a secondary function, which is easier to use, and it just looks for the correct button in the image taken and presses it!







# Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down
# Never gonna run around and desert you
# Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye
# Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
